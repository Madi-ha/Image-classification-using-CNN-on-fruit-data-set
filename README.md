### Fruit Image Classification using CNN and Transfer Learning

## 📌 Overview
This project implements a deep learning-based **multi-class image classification system** to recognize different types of fruits using the **Fruit-360 dataset**. It demonstrates the complete computer vision workflow including preprocessing, CNN training, transfer learning, and evaluation.

The project also explores how pre-trained architectures improve performance compared to a baseline CNN model.
