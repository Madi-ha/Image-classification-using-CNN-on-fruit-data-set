Fruit Classification using CNNs
Overview

This project implements CNN-based fruit classification using the Fruits-360 dataset. A custom CNN and transfer learning models (VGG16, ResNet50) are used to achieve high accuracy and enable real-time image prediction.

Objectives

Build a baseline CNN model

Apply transfer learning with VGG16 and ResNet50

Fine-tune models to achieve >90% accuracy

Evaluate using accuracy, precision, recall, F1-score, and confusion matrix

Implement real-time fruit image prediction

Methodology

Dataset: Fruits-360 (10 classes)

Preprocessing: Resize (100×100), normalization, data augmentation

Models: Custom CNN, VGG16, ResNet50

Tools: TensorFlow/Keras, scikit-learn, Google Colab (GPU)
